## Project Description
Fitness Buddy is an AI-powered fitness form analysis tool that helps users perfect their workout technique. Users can either upload pre-recorded workout videos or record themselves live using their webcam. The app then processes the video through Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model to provide detailed analysis including:

- Exercise identification and form assessment
- Specific corrections for improper technique
- Safety warnings for potentially dangerous movements
- Positive reinforcement for good form
- Actionable advice for improvement

The app features a clean, modern UI with real-time video preview, loading states, and comprehensive error handling. It's designed to make professional-level fitness coaching accessible to everyone.
