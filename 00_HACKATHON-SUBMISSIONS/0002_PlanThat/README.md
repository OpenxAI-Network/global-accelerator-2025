# PlanThat - AI-Powered Event Planning Application

## Project Information
- Name: Nathan Roland
- Teamname: Dr Banana
- Project Name: PlanThat
- Track Specification: Social Network

## Project Description

PlanThat is an innovative AI-powered social event planning platform that revolutionises how people discover, plan, and organise meetups with friends. By leveraging local AI models and real-time geospatial data, PlanThat eliminates the overwhelming decision-making process that often prevents people from organising social gatherings.

### **The Problem**
Planning social events is typically a time-consuming and frustrating experience. Users struggle with:
- **Decision paralysis**: Too many options and conflicting preferences
- **Location discovery**: Finding suitable venues that accommodate everyone's needs
- **Coordination complexity**: Managing multiple people's schedules and preferences
- **Information overload**: Researching venues, reviews, and logistics
- **Recurring themes**: Going to the same place continuously because nothing else stands out to them

### **The Solution**
PlanThat streamlines the entire event planning process through intelligent automation:

**ü§ñ AI-Powered Recommendations**: Our local Llama3.2:3b AI model analyzes user preferences, dietary restrictions, activity interests, and location data to generate personalised venue recommendations with detailed descriptions, pricing, and availability.

**üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Geospatial Discovery**: Real-time integration with OpenStreetMap data provides comprehensive Points of Interest (POIs) including restaurants, bars, cafes, entertainment venues, and cultural attractions, all visualised on interactive maps.

**üë• Social Network Integration**: Built-in friend management system with friend requests, real-time notifications, and collaborative event planning features that make coordinating with groups seamless.

**üìÖ Smart Calendar Management**: Integrated event creation, invitation system, and participant management with the ability to edit, delete, and manage event details dynamically.

**üîñ Personalized Experience**: User bookmarking system, preference sliders, and activity categorization ensure recommendations become more accurate over time.

**üì± Responsive Design**: Modern, intuitive interface that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, making event planning accessible anywhere.

### **Key Differentiators**
- **Privacy-First**: Local AI processing ensures user data never leaves their device
- **Real-Time Data**: Live integration with OpenStreetMap for up-to-date venue information
- **Social-Centric**: Built specifically for group coordination and social interaction
- **Intelligent Automation**: Reduces planning time from hours to minutes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports diverse event types from casual meetups to formal gatherings

PlanThat transforms the complex, often frustrating process of event planning into a delightful, efficient experience that encourages more social connections and meaningful gatherings.

## üöÄ Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd 00_HACKATHON-SUBMISSIONS/0002_PlanThat

# Activate virtual environment (if not already activated)

```bash
# Navigate to the Next.js app directory
cd 00_HACKATHON-SUBMISSIONS/0002_PlanThat/nextjs-app

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001

## üîß Configuration

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following default configuration:
- **Database**: `planthat_db`
- **User**: `nathanroland`
- **Password**: `password`
- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Port**: `5432`

You can modify these settings in `db_config.py` if needed.

**No additional environment variables are required!** The application uses:
- **OpenStreetMap tiles** (free, no API key required)
- **Hardcoded backend URL** (`http://localhost:5001`)

### AI Model Configuration

The application uses Ollama for AI-powered recommendations. You can change the model by:

1. Pulling a different model: `ollama pull <model-name>`
2. Updating the model name in `ollama-model.txt`

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:

- `users`: User accounts and profiles
- `friends`: Friend relationships
- `friend_requests`: Pending friend requests
- `bookmarks`: User bookmarked locations
- `notifications`: User notifications
- `regular_calendar`: Events and meetings
- `event_to_user`: Event participants
- `invitation_to_regular_calendar_event`: Event invitations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Check database credentials in `db_config.py`
   - Verify database and user exist

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change port in `app.py` (line with `app.run()`)
   - Kill existing processes using the port

3. **Ollama Model Not Found**
   - Run `ollama list` to see available models
   - Pull the required model: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`

4. **Node.js Dependencies**
   - Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
   - Run `npm install` again

### Logs and Debugging

- **Backend logs**: Check terminal where Flask is running
- **Frontend logs**: Check browser console (F12)
- **Database logs**: Check PostgreSQL logs
