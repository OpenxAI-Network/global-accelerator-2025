## Setup & Run Instructions
Clone this repository 

` https://github.com/Pratiksalunke19/global-accelerator-2025.git `

Navigate to project folder:

` cd 00_HACKTHON_SUBMISSIONS/0001_learn-trace`

Install dependencies:

` npm install `

Start development server:

` npm run dev `

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Project Description
LearnTrace helps learners see their thought process.
Every question, answer, and follow-up is stored in a graph structure that branches like a mind map.

- Chat Mode: Ask questions and get AI answers.

- Graph Mode: Visualize your learning journey as connected nodes.

- Revision Mode (planned): Generate quizzes automatically from past learning sessions.

- Persistence: All chats and graph data are stored in Supabase for seamless switching between devices.

- Multi-Chat Support: Keep separate graphs for different topics, switch easily.

- Graph Editing: Delete nodes and re-link children to maintain structure.

## Innovation & Impact

Unlike traditional chatbots where knowledge gets lost in scrolling history, LearnTrace turns every conversation into a knowledge map.

- Makes learning traceable and organized.

- Encourages active recall through visual connections.

- Helps educators and learners track progress and knowledge gaps.

- Planned IPFS export ensures that learning paths can be verified, shared, and preserved in a decentralized way.

  <br/>

## Future Plans

- Sharing of mind maps/graphs between users

- Quiz Generation from graph data for revision mode.

- Automated IPFS Uploads for decentralized verification.

- Collaboration Mode for shared learning graphs.

- Advanced Graph Search to find past concepts instantly.

- LLM Customization for domain-specific learning.
